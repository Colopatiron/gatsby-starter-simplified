  Gatsby simplified starter
</h1>

<p align='center'>
This is a simplified version of the default Gatsby boilerplate.<br>
See <a href='https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default'>gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default</a>.
</p>

---

This is the same as the default starter pack, except with these omissions:

- All default CSS has been removed.
- Extraneous config files have been removed.
- Service workers support (`gatsby-plugin-offline`) has been removed.
- Responsive image support (`gatsby-image`) has been removed.
- Image optimization (`gatsby-plugin-sharp`) has been removed.

These things have been added:

- Normalize/reset CSS ([sanitize.css](https://yarn.pm/sanitize.css)) has been added.
- Docker support for development (see [developer notes](CONTRIBUTING.md)) has been added.

These omissions can be added back as you need them; see [extras](EXTRAS.md) for notes on how to do that.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for developer notes.
